This React component uses the `useState` hook to manage its state. However, it attempts to update the state asynchronously using `setTimeout`, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the component unmounts before the timeout completes. This can cause a warning in the console, such as 'Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.'
